3-Dimensional Gasoline Combustion Simulation and Analysis

Goal:

Analyze reaction kinetics of a gasoline-oxygen combustion reaction at varying conditions, including variable temperature, pressure, volume, concentration, and fuel-grade. 

Introduction:

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the velocity of each molecule in each dimension.The Box-Muller transform is used as a pseduorandom number generator describing the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as a gaussian distribution. Particle kinematics described in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.

Each molecule will have their constituent atoms represented as a sphere, the orientation will be described in their respective species class definitions.
